          UX Design works on the premise of design thinking and generates a set of deliverables. Through the various stages of design process, UX practitioners empathise with end-users, identify their unique needs, brainstorm creative ideas, create rapid prototypes and validate the end designs. UX deliverables are the output generated at the end of the design process which helps designers communicate with stakeholders, key executives and team members. The timeless list of UX deliverables involves user persona, empathy maps, paper sketches, wireframes, clickable prototypes and more.
